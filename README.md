# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Project 1 - Visualize Data with a Bar Chart

See the result here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-bar-chart/

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Data Visualization using D3.js library.

The data used comes from the Bureau of Economics Analysis (https://www.bea.gov/) and is accessible [here](http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipaguid.pdf) Bar Chart shows the Gross Domestic Product in United States for years 1947 - 2015.

The project answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart with the tests that can be run from the page itself.
