# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Project 1 - Visualize Data with a Bar Chart

See the result here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-bar-chart/

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Data Visualization using D3.js library.

The data used comes from the Bureau of Economics Analysis (https://www.bea.gov/) and is accessible [here](http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipaguid.pdf) Bar Chart shows the Gross Domestic Product in United States for years 1947 - 2015.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It is built using the React Library coupled to Styled-Components and Material UI components for the styling along with eslint and prettier extensions for linting and code formatting.

LightHouse audits have also been added to workflow using github actions in order to keep track of the application's performance using Lighthouse Reports

It answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart with the tests that can be run from the page itself.
